Analyzing factors that affect a movieâ€™s success or failure. Focus should be laid on both, entertainment of the audience (good content) and gaining tremendous profit.
Initial Data Wrangling and cleaning to understand data and gain preliminary insights.
Checking for correlations/dependency of variables, and other assumptions prior to model building and algorithm deployment.
Model developement using various machine learning algorithms :
  * Dependent Variable will be IMDB Score
  * Logistic Regression and basic Decision Trees
  * Random Forests and Gradient Boost (Advanced Trees)
  * Tuning parameters and other components to get good results
  * Finally, model validation by calculating misclassification rates
